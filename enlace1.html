		<h1>Type of articial inteligense </h1>
		<h3>1 Reactive machine</h3>
		<p>
			It is the most basic type of artificial intelligence. It is only based on decisions about the present moment, but you cannot analyze past data or learn from it. That is, it does not evolve.

An example of this type of artificial intelligence would be, for example, the aforementioned Deep Blue computer. This computer was able to recognize the figures on the board and process 200 million movements in a second. However, that was his only goal: to process what was the best move in real time based on what his opponent performed. However, outside of that, Deep Blue ignores any past or future data external to the game or the next move's processing.
		</p>
		<h3>2 limited memory</h3>	
		<p>
			Machines that use this type of artificial intelligence are capable of looking into the past, but in a limited way. That is, you can store the information you collect for a certain time, and add it to your programming to create new patterns of behavior.

The problem is that this information is only added for a limited time and they are not capable of making complete and lasting representations as in the case of a human being.
		</p>
		<h3>3 Theory of mind</h3>
		<p>
			
At this point would be those systems or machines capable of understanding how the people, objects or systems that surround them work. In other words, these artificial intelligences learn based on our behaviors and, based on them, they know what our tastes, needs, desires or how we expect to be treated.

This type of AI is capable of understanding the environment that surrounds it, and is an important step in order to carry out a social interaction closer to what would be expected of a human.
		</p>
		<h3>4 Self-awareness</h3>
		<p>
			
We reach swampy terrain, usually reserved for science fiction. It is about artificial intelligence being aware of itself and recognizing itself as an independent entity and capable of making decisions, differentiating between itself and the objects / people / systems that surround it.

There are still no machines or systems that are aware of themselves, beyond the evil intelligences that we know from movies like '2001: a space odyssey' (HAL) or 'Terminator 2' (Skynet), or from books like 'I have no mouth and I must scream '.
