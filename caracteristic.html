			<h1>Characteristics of artificial intelligence</h1>
			<h2>1. Elimination of monotonous tasks</h2>
		<p>It implies that an artificial intelligence system continues to do the task as ordered, no matter how many times it has to be done. This also leads to minimizing errors and human costs.</p>

			<h2>2. Handling a large amount of data</h2>
			<p>It represents one of the most relevant aspects of the characteristics of artificial intelligence. Artificially intelligent systems handle large amounts of data. Even a small company of about fifty employees has enormous amounts of data to analyze, which can be managed thanks to these systems. In addition, information is stored from multiple sources.

			<h2>3. Imitation of human cognition</h2>
			<p>It is one of the most outstanding characteristics of artificial intelligence. The reason? Well, through these systems the way in which the human mind thinks and solves problems is imitated. So inferences are made, the environment is interpreted, and decisions are made (Mazurek, 2019). It is possible that not everything can be identical; however, developers and scientists work hard to fully achieve this feature.</p>

			<h2>4. They are futuristic</h2>
			
			<p>Businesses that use artificial intelligence can count on the perception of the environment to find opportunities. For example, an autonomous vehicle records the speed of nearby cars and attempts to execute patterns similar to those found in traffic. Through technologies such as machine learning, data can be entered into algorithms and a certain goal can be achieved in various scenarios.</p>
